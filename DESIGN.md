# Oneplan — design system

Oneplan is a visual day planner. The reference class studied before any code was
written was **Tiimo** (ADHD task & planning assistant, Apple Design Award
finalist 2024) — roughly 30 real shipping screens across its onboarding, Today,
To-do, add-activity and Focus flows, pulled from Mobbin.

What was taken is the **pattern**, not the pixels.

## The patterns adopted, and why

| Pattern | Where it came from | Why it works |
|---|---|---|
| High-contrast **serif display** over a neutral UI sans | Tiimo's `Thursday` / `Focus` / question headlines | The serif carries all the warmth so every *control* can stay quiet. One display size per screen. |
| **Time-of-day buckets** (Anytime / Morning / Afternoon / Evening) as tinted pills with counts | Tiimo's `MORNING (3)` chips | A loose ordering beats a timetable for people who cannot predict their own pace, but still gives the day a shape. |
| **Colour as data**, not decoration | Tiimo's pastel activity discs | The tint *is* how a day gets scanned without reading. This is the accessibility affordance, not styling. |
| **Emoji as the activity's identity** inside a tinted disc | Tiimo task rows | Picture-first recall. Emoji is content here; it never appears in chrome. |
| **Nested checklist with a `0/4` progress strip** | Tiimo's routine rows | Lets a "routine" be one row when calm and four steps when stuck. |
| **Countdown ring around the activity's own icon** | Tiimo Focus | Time becomes an area that visibly shrinks — the core idea of visual time management. |
| **Floating pill tab bar** (To-do / Today / Focus / Me) | Tiimo | The product's most recognisable chrome. Still the real Tabs navigator underneath. |

## Colour contract

1. **One accent — `#7A5AF8`.** It owns every interactive, progress and active
   state, on every screen. There is no second accent.
2. **`accentInk` is the same hue, darkened for text.** Accent *fills and
   strokes* use `accent`; accent-coloured *text and glyphs* on tinted surfaces
   use `accentInk`, because `accent` on `accentSoft` measures only 3.7:1. It is
   one accent at two lightnesses, not two accents.
3. **`TINTS` is a data-encoding palette, not an accent set.** Six hues plus one
   neutral, each with a light and dark pair, used *only* for activity discs and
   time-of-day chips. This is the one deliberate exception to single-accent
   discipline, and it is load-bearing rather than decorative.

   Six, not eight. Eight pastels forced neighbours (peach/clay, butter/sage)
   down to **deltaE ~8**, which reads as the same colour and defeats the whole
   premise. The six-hue set measures **deltaE 14.2 minimum in light, 12.8 in
   dark**, and every foreground clears 5.2:1 on its own background. When colour
   *is* the data, separation beats variety.
4. **One grey family: warm**, in a three-step ramp — `ink` / `inkMuted` /
   `inkFaint` — where every step clears 4.5:1 on every surface it is used on, in
   both themes.
5. **`surfaceSelected` exists because selection and recession are opposites in
   dark mode.** A selected tab chip must *lift* off the bar while a recessed
   checklist strip must *sink* into the card; sharing one token made the active
   tab invisible in dark.
6. Both themes are defined token-for-token in `src/theme/tokens.ts`. No screen
   defines a colour of its own — the audit for hardcoded hex outside the token
   file returns zero.

## Shape contract

Actions and chips are **pills**; cards **16**; sheets **24**; inputs **12**;
inner progress bars **8**. Circles are `size / 2`. Every rounded *rectangle*
carries `borderCurve: 'continuous'`.

## Spacing and type scaling

4pt base. Gaps come from flexbox `gap`, not stacked margins. ScrollView padding
lives in `contentContainerStyle`.

Every `lineHeight` in the ramp is **multiplied by the clamped font scale** at
render time. React Native scales `fontSize` with Dynamic Type but leaves an
absolute `lineHeight` untouched, so a fixed value shears the glyphs at large
text sizes — invisible at 100%, and the reason "Quick tidy" rendered as
"Quick tidv" at XXXL before this was fixed.

## Motion vocabulary

Decided by the frequency gate, in this order:

- **Tab switches and screen transitions**: the platform default, untouched.
  Tabs never slide.
- **Press feedback** (tens of times a day): 120ms, ease-out
  `bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)`, on press-*in*. Buttons and cards scale to 0.97;
  list rows take a background highlight and never scale.
- **Gestures**: the focus dial tracks the finger 1:1 on the UI thread, snaps to
  a whole minute on release with `{ duration: 400, dampingRatio: 1 }`, and has a
  haptic detent every five minutes.
- **The countdown ring** sweeps with a single long `withTiming` on the UI
  thread; only the numeric readout re-renders, once per second.
- **Reduce Motion** collapses spatial motion to cross-fades throughout.

## Navigation grammar

| Destination | Presentation | Back does |
|---|---|---|
| Onboarding | Its own stack | **One-way door.** `Stack.Protected` drops every entry when `onboarded` flips, so back cannot re-enter it. |
| Today / To-do / Focus / Me | Tabs (peers) | Each keeps its own stack; re-tapping the active tab pops to root. |
| Task detail | `push` | Returns to the list it came from. |
| Add activity | `formSheet`, detents `[0.58, 0.96]` | Drag-dismiss; **asks first** if there is unsaved work. |
| Destructive confirms, layout options | Native action sheet | — |

## Icons

SF Symbols for **all** chrome, via a wrapper that renders a sized spacer as a
fallback so layout never shifts. The single bespoke glyph is the Today tab's
calendar, because it is data-bearing: it shows the current date.

## State

- Zustand + **MMKV**. MMKV is synchronous, so the store rehydrates before the
  first paint — which is what makes the root redirect resolve on frame one
  instead of flashing onboarding at a returning user.
- Ephemeral UI state (collapsed sections, expanded steps, drafts) stays local.
- High-frequency typing surfaces use uncontrolled `TextInput`s.
- Lists are virtualised with FlashList; no row carries an `entering` animation,
  because recycled rows would replay it.
